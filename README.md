## About the project:

In this assignment we implemented a game based on the previous assignment (# graphs).
The game has a directed weighted graph with fruits (bananas and apples) and robots.
The aim of the robots is to collect as much fruits as possible (together).

You can play the manual game or watch the automatic game based on navigation algorithms.
